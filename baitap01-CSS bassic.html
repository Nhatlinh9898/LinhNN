          <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
          <p>
               Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
          </p>
     </div>
     <br>
     <div class="text1">
     <p>       With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of the text, the spacing between elements,
          how elements should be positioned and laid out, what background images or backgrounds colors are to be used,
          different display for different devices and sizes, and much more!
     </p>
     </div>
     <div class="text2"> 
          <p>
               <b>Tip:</b>The word <b>cascading</b> means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements
          within the parent. so, if you set the color for the body text to ""blue"", all headings, paragraphs,
          and other text elements within the body will also get the same color(unless you specify something else. )
